What is your favorite / least favorite place for food on campus?

Favorite Place is either the Exchange or Tepper.  Least favorite is probably ABP or Hunan.

What do you like / dislike about it?

Exchange has really good fresh food and Tepper does as well.  ABP always messes up orders and is almost always out of stuff I want.  Hunan the food is never fresh.
